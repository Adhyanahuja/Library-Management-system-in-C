2. The input files are issuelist and temporary. Issuelist file is used to store the record of the members who have issued a book. It contains the
   member names and the respective books they have issued. We have pre-issued 3 books with our name which will be visible to you in the display issue 
   list menu inside the book transaction menu.Once a member returns the book, the name of that particular member is removed from the list. Temporary file 
   is used in removing a name from that list, when we want to remove a member from that list, we copy the entire data of issuelist into this file and open 
   it for updating the details of the entry that was selected by the user to remove and we leave that entry empty hence it does not exist anymore in the 
   record or we can say that entry has been removed and later we copy the modified data back into our issuelist file from the temporary file.
 
3. When you run the exe, it will prompt you Portal opening page.This page shows the newly added books and a books back in stock
   box(initially empty) which is autoupdated once an existing book(currently in our library) is ordered from the vendors or other libraries. You 
   will be asked to select to login or exit. Further in login you will be asked a username and password. The username is "bitspilani" and password
   is "bitslms" (quotes not included).
 
4. Further, there will be a prompt which will ask you to select any of the 5 main menus which were asked in the question.
 
5. To search for books, you have to press 1 and enter then you will be directed to the book management menu.You can ask to display all the
   books, search the books using their names, issue number and authors aswell. You can refer to the details to be entered using the library
   details given above the instructions or you can refer the book details after pressing the display books option. This menu allows you to search any
   book detail by searching its name, its authors name or its issue number.

6. To make a book transaction(issue or return) then press 2 and enter. You will have to enter your name and the name of the book while issuing
   and returning. It is advisable for you to enter the correct name of the book as per our records in the library. You can also check
   the list of people who have issued a book in this menu which is stored in a file. If the book is out of stock(no. of copies = 0) then
   you will recieve an option if you want to be alerted when the book comes back in the library. You will also recieve a message to return 
   the book within 15 days after issuing it.

7. To access the vendor management, press 3 and enter. You will see two options of logging in either as a student or as an admin. In order for a
   student to place a request to the library to get a new book, they have to login as student, username is "studentuser" and password
   is "studentpwd".You can place requests to the library to order existing books(incase that book is unavailable in the library) or any new book 
   so that they can order to the vendors and other libraries. While ordering a new book, you will be asked for an issue number so you can
   enter any 3 digit number in that case as its just for its unique identification. We have provided an admin login which can be accessed
   using username = "adminuser" and password = "adminpwd", these credentials can be used to login as student aswell because admin has the
   superaccess for the menu.After logging into this menu, in order to accept the requests of the students, you have to press 2 and the order
   for that particular book will be placed and it will be added accordingly into the library database. You would like to check the first login
   page(had an empty box with title books back in stock) after placed and accepted an order for an existing book using this menu where that earlier
   empty box will now be updated with the book back in stock and thus alerting the users.

8. To access the inventory management menu, press 4 and enter. You can use this menu to count the number of copies of a particular book in the 
   library by entering the books name.

9. To access the user management menu, press 5. You can check the existing member list which initially includes all three of us. You can add members and
   remove them from the library using this menu. In order to remove a member from the list, you will be prompted to enter the serial number of the member
   in the display list hence before removing, you may have to check the display member list before.

THOUGH WE HAVE COMPLETED NEARLY ALL THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE QUESTION,
Known limitations of the code:
1. This program requires you to strictly enter a number input in the menu when asked to pick an option(as this is our input to the switch statements used everywhere)
   or a number in particular, if "A" is entered instead of "1" then the code might misbehave hence it is strongly recommended to enter a number input when asked to do so.
2. This program can not send an alert after 15 days to each particular user who issued a book but it prints a message to do so at checkout.
3. This program might show error if incorrect details are written in the return book menu which is present inside the book transaction menu so it is advisable to enter
   the correct details while using this option.
4. In the vendor management menu when we login as admin, the admin is unable to see the requests that the students have made to order the books, the admin
   can only accept the request but the request cant be displayed. 
5. Main book database structure array can not save data once the program has ended as it was way beyond the scope of ours in c programming language to save it 
   in a file using structure array and reading it at multiple places. So the data updated in the structure while running the program gets erased once the program ends.
6. The linked list used in the user management system can not save data once the program has ended as we were unable to save the linked list in a file.
